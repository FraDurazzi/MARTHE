This repository contain the code related to the study "Modelling antimicrobial resistance transmission to guide personalized antimicrobial stewardship interventions and infection control policies in healthcare setting: a pilot study".
Data can not be shared.

The notebook prevalence_verona.ipynb shows the data processing, the model equations and the fitting procedure for unknown parameters value.

The script sensitivity_analysis.py generates all the combinations of 3 different values for each parameter and predicts the scenarios.

The notebook sensitivity_results.ipynb loads the outputs of sensitivity_analysis.py and computes the metrics shown in the manuscript, such as the cooperation coefficient.
